PROJECT : "AI FLAPPY BIRD" BY NEUROEVOLUTION OF AUGMENTING TOPOLOGIES(NEAT) ALGORITHM


DOCUMENTATION GIVEN


DESCRIPTION:
   The algothrim is simple neural network, where the neurons are coupled between the layeres. The coupling proceeds Through the 
generations, where the good traits(weights and biases) are filtered and boosted based on the points that I given in the code 
For Example : when a bird cross a pipe it gains a points and its traits are passed on to the next generation. So in every generation 
the bird gets better in progress.


TIME TAKEN TO COMPLETE : 9 HOURS
